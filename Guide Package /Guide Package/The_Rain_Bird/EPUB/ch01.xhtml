						<p>That night the villagers held a meeting.They
							all agreed that they had learned a valuable
							lesson.
						</p>
						<p>
							And from that day onwards, not one week
							passed without a special trip to the forest to
							feed the bird that brought the rain.

						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="column2">
						<img src="images/page_one_image_one.jpg"/>
						<p>In a country called Gabon, a little village
							stood at the very edge of a forest.
						</p>
						<p>In the heart of this forest, in the highest
							branches of an enormous tree, lived a very
							special bird âˆ’ the bird that made rain.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

						<img src="images/page_two_image_one.jpg"/>
						<p>For as far back as the villagers could
							remember, they had taken the time to keep
							this bird happy.
						</p>
						<p>
							They saved scraps of bread, pieces of fruit
							and fresh coconut milk, and every week or
							two a group of villagers took these delicacies
							into the forest. When they had laid them at
							the base of the tree, one of them played a
							simple tune on the thumb piano.

						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column3"></div>
					<div class="column2">
						<img src="images/page_two_image_two.jpg"/>
						<p>It was her father who had woken up!
							"I'm sorry!" he said again and again to the
							big, blue bird. Then he held out his hand to
							his daughter and they walked slowly back to
							the village.
						</p>
						<p>In the village all the people and animals
							were alive again.

						<p>Finally, what she wanted most in the world
							happened.
						</p>
						<p>
							Down swooped the bird as if nothing had
							happened. The bird ate some of the berries
							still lying on the ground and sang a few
							notes. Then, as Ketti played on, the bird
							raised her wings.

						</p>
						<p>Ketti heard a rustle behind her.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column3"></div>
					<div class="column2">
						<img src="images/page_three_image_two.jpg"/>
						<p>After a while, the bird flew down to the
							ground to eat and drink. When she had
							finished, she began to sing the most
							beautiful song.
						</p>
						<p>At the same time, she raised her dark, shiny
							blue wings, and within minutes, the rain
							began to fall.
						</p>

				<div class="wrapper">
					<div class="column1">

						<p>This went on for many years. Because the
							rain fell regularly, the crops grew
							abundantly and there was plenty of food in
							the village.
						</p>
						<p>
							But gradually things began to change.
							Somehow, the villagers were always busy
							and they began to neglect the rain bird.
							"It will rain anyway," they said. "It's time to
							stop spoiling that silly old bird!"

						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column3"></div>
					<div class="column2">
						<img src="images/page_four_image_two.jpg"/>
						<p>Half an hour later, Ketti was back at the
							base of the big tree. Her body was drenched
							with sweat and she was gasping for breath.
							A few paces away from her lay the lifeless
							body of her father.
						</p>
						<p>Ketti looked away quickly, and with
							trembling hands, began to play the thumb
							piano. She played and played, until her
							fingers hurt.
						</p>
					</div>

			<div class="page-five">

				<div class="wrapper">
					<div class="column1">
						<img src="images/page_five_image_one.jpg"/>
						<p>Ketti raced out of the forest to a scene of
							utter devastation. Every animal and every
							person she saw lay dead on the ground.
							With a pounding heart, she ran all the way
							back to her home.
						</p>
						<p>
							She quickly found her granny's old thumb
							piano. "This is my only hope!" she thought.
							"The rain bird is angry. I have to make her
							happy again! I HAVE to!"

						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column3"></div>
					<div class="column2">
						<img src="images/page_five_image_two.jpg"/>
						<p>
							But the people were wrong. When they
							stopped looking after the bird, the rain
							stopped falling.
						</p>
						<p>
							The crops began to dry up and die, and the
							animals grew thin and weak. Still, nobody in
							the village went into the forest to feed the
							bird that brought the rain. Now they were all
							too busy trying to find money to buy food in
							the neighbouring town.

            <div class="page-six">

                        <p>One scorching day, a young girl called Ketti
							decided to go into the forest after school. "At
							least it will be cool in there," she thought.
							She walked and walked, and after some
							time, she came to the tall tree in which the
							rain bird lived. Ketti stared up at the tree.
						</p>
                        <p>
							Suddenly, she remembered how her granny
							had taken her into the forest to feed the bird
							when she was still a tiny child. Ketti opened
							her school bag and pulled out a piece of
							bread left over from her lunch. Carefully she
							laid the bread at the base of the tree. Then
							because she had no thumb piano, she sang
							an old song that she had known all her life.

						</p>
                    </div>
					<div class="column3"></div>
					<div class="column2">
                        <img src="images/page_six_image_two.jpg"/>
                        <p>"I'll teach that child a lesson!" he said to
							himself angrily. He snatched his bow and
							arrows and silently followed Ketti into the
							forest. Just as the bird flew down to eat the
							food that Ketti had set out for it, her father
							raised his bow and released his deadly
							arrow. The arrow flew straight into the bird's
							heart. The bird let out a piercing shriek.
						</p>
                        <p>Terrified, Ketti spun around − just in time to
							see her father fall down, stone dead. Ketti
							screamed and turned around − just in time
							to see the arrow fall harmlessly from the
							bird's glossy body.
						</p>
                    </div>

						<img src="images/page_seven_image_one.jpg"/>
						<p>So, early the next morning, after taking a
							slice of bread and a handful of red berries
							from the kitchen, Ketti slipped out of the
							house. She began to make her way to the
							centre of the forest.
						</p>
						<p>
							What she didn't realise, was that her father
							was also awake. When he saw what his
							daughter was doing, he realised that she
							was going to feed the rain bird again.

						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column3"></div>
					<div class="column2">
						<img src="images/page_seven_image_two.jpg"/>
						<p>With a loud whooshing sound, a beautiful
							blue bird swooped out of the branches
							above Ketti's head and began to eat the
							bread. When the bird had finished, she
							opened her mouth and sang a few pure,
							high notes. Then she raised her shiny wings
							and all of a sudden Ketti heard the rumble
							of thunder. By the time she reached her
							home, giant rain drops were pelting down,
							cooling the baking red earth.

				<div class="wrapper">
					<div class="column1">
						<img src="images/page_eight_image_one.jpg"/>
						<p>Ketti was very happy, until she told her
							parents what had happened.
							"Don't be silly!" scolded her mother. "Nobody
							believes that bird has anything to do with
							the rain anymore!"
							"Your mother is right," said Ketti's father.
							"The drought has been broken now and we
							will be fine. Don't go wasting good bread
							feeding that greedy old bird again!"
						</p>
						<p>
							But Ketti's granny had died a few years
							earlier. The only thing Ketti had left, was her
							granny's old thumb piano.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column3"></div>
					<div class="column2">
						<img src="images/page_eight_image_two.jpg"/>
						<p>Two weeks passed and there was no more
							rain. The crops began to shrivel up again
							and the hungry animals' ribs began to stick
							out even more. The sun beat down
							mercilessly from a glaring blue sky.
						</p>
						<p>
							"I don't care what they say!" thought Ketti.
							"We need rain. I'm going to feed the bird
							again tomorrow!"
